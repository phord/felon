Following are some design notes and ideas useful only to me, perhaps.

Originally felon was intended to be a faster word-based file indexer, capable of knowing everywhere a word existed in a file all at once.
The expectation was that this could be faster than regular expression searching after the fact. The expectation was incorrect, at least in my implementation.
It's not a new idea; it dates back to the 1940's, and an [intern at Google used it](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html) in some modern tools there for a while.
Anyway, it turned out to be not terribly fast, in the end, and regex seems plenty fast enough.  Continuing with that for now.

Design:

FileReader - reads lines of text from the file
    Can be adapted to read from compressed files with memoized decompressor states for faster random access

Iterators
    Index-on-demand
    Line offsets
    Line and data
    Subline and data

TextBuffer - buffer to hold lines of text
    Supports indexed lines so external classes can read subsets by reference
    Can backfill from FileReader if a line is missing
    Some kind of LRU feature to drop old lines and limit memory usage

TextList - ordered set of lines referenced in a TextBuffer

SearchPhrase - a way to match text; e.g. regex, substring, time range, etc.

SearchExpr - a search expression made of one or more SearchPhrases and conjunctions
    Can be combined with other SearchExpr to make up more complex expressions

Features/Ideas:
    - Recognize/parse timestamps to support time-based filters, goto, timedelta, etc.
    - Able to show context lines (eg. -A5 -C3)
    - Highlight matches in colors (with different colors for different expressions)
    - Spool data from stdin
    - Automatically recognize log-line patterns; allows to quickly say "show all of these lines"
        - Needs to be smart enough to ignore prefix (timestamp, pid, etc.)
    - Auto-expand grouped lines (with C markers)


----

High-level todos:
    - [ ] Remove coloring
        - Simplify presentation / testing / portability
        - Reapply semantic coloring in sub-line indexing
    - [x] Show index status on statusline
    - [ ] Identify weird character widths (unicode, tabs, ctrl-chars)
        - Expand control chars (<^A>, <^H>, TAB to Spaces, etc.)
        - Count others for proper display-width matching
    - [x] Add gzip support
    - [x] Search
    - [ ] Dynamic Config
        - Allows runtime modification, like '-S', '-N', etc.
    - [ ] Implement -N (line numbers) with dynamic updating and/or relative indexing (e.g. "end-10000")
    - [ ] Custom line stylers
    - [ ] TUI framework for cleaner painting
    - [ ] Wait for events to settle/resolve before painting
    - [ ] If no alt-screen and lines < display_height, don't fill whole screen?  (see less for something like git pager usage)
        - Something like -K support to exit when no paging needed, too.

Commands I need:
    Toggle filters / colors temporarily
    Change search highlight colors
    Toggle highlights



Display filters:
    SHOW - Show all lines that match
    HIDE - Hide all lines that match
    MARK - Highlight all matches

Need to be able to disable / enable filters individually and collectively.

Every line knows its timestamp for `goto`, `delta`, and merging, but don't parse the time until it's needed.

`less` already supports filtering built-in, btw.
